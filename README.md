# Aim
The aim of this project is to design and develop a locomotion controller & a game that can detect physical locomotion of human legs and then
translate it into a readable game input for a Virtual Reality (VR) game. This game is made using Unity3Dand CLOVR plugin (Unity asset store).

# Locomotion Controller
Two locomotion controller are built for this project using Arduino. Each controller has the ability to detect in-place movements such as
walking-in-place (WIP), running-in-place (RIP) and jumping-in-place (JIP). Each controller is made up of:
1x Arduino Nano
1x MPU6050 (3DOF accelerometer & gyroscope)
1x 3m tether wire (USB extension)
