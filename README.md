# About
This is a Virtual Reality (VR) game that uses proprietery locomotion controller made using Arduino and sensor modules as an input.

# Gameplay
The player play as a postman (hence the mails you see in pictures above) and navigate around the map to collect mails and coins using their physical legs as a input. The player are advised to use in-place-movements such as walking-in-place (WIP), running-in-place (RIP) and jumping-in-place (JIP).

# Level Design
The virtual environment plays an important role in VR games, especially *Airo* as it dictates the immersion of navigation

# Aim
The aim of this project is to design and develop a locomotion controller & a game that can detect physical locomotion of human legs and then
translate it into a readable game input for a Virtual Reality (VR) game. This game is made using Unity3Dand CLOVR plugin (Unity asset store).

# Locomotion Controller
Two locomotion controller are built for this project using Arduino. Each controller has the ability to detect the in-place movements mentioned above.
**Each controller is made up of:**
* 1x Arduino Nano
* 1x MPU6050 (3DOF accelerometer & gyroscope)
* 1x 3m tether wire (USB extension)

# Testings & Results
Testings are done in our universityâ€™s lab on 28/1/2020. It involves *6* people. It has lesser results as the game testing criteria was changed and we required new testers to test the game. Results are gathered and compiled and is shown below.

The following bar chart shows the Gameplay Experience Questionaire (GEQ) result taken from *14* users who player the game. The GEQ are taken on both 28/1/2020 and 7/2/2020.
